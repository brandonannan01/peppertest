#Example in the Nuance document: His name is <ESC>\pause=300\ Michael.
proposal: %intro This is using the pause statement between is and Michael.  His name is \pause=1300\ Michael.
    ^nextProposal


#this is what works:
proposal: This is using the p a u statement between is and Michael.  His name is \pau=1300\ Michael.
    ^nextProposal

proposal: %nuance Nuance has a statement to add a pause to the end of a sentance called wait.  Here is an example.  \pau=1000\

    There will be a short wait period after this sentence. \wait=2\
    This sentence will be followed by a long wait period. 
    \wait=6\ 
    Did you notice the difference?  If not, this means the wait statement is not supported.
