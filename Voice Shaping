#u:(in:onActivation) ^goto(nuance)

proposal: %intro In this example, the Acepela statements are accepted and the Nuance documented statement is not.  Say 1 for Acapela or 2 for Nuance.

# Acapela Doc Voice Shaping in percent: 70 % â€¦. 140% ...seems to work well
proposal: %acapela  This will shape the voice from 70 through 140 percent using the Acapela statements.

# This is the pitch statement from Nuance
# Example from the document seems to mix rate and pitch:
# I can <ESC>\pitch=80\ speak lower <ESC>\rate=120\ or speak higher.
proposal: %nuance This will change the pitch of the voice using the Nuance statements.
