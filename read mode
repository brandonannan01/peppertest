# Programmer: Brandon.C.Annan@sprint.com
# Comments:
# CharacterMode says "full stop" at the end
# Line by line mode doesnt put a pause at the end of each line (per example)
# >\readmode=explicit_eos\  mode doesnt put a pause at the end of each line (per example even with the periods)....need to test this more.

# u:(in:onActivation) ^goto(char)

# u:(in:onActivation) ^goto(line)
# u:(in:onActivation) ^goto(eos)
