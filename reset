# Comments: Reset from both Acapela and Nuance do not seem honored, needs to be \rst=<some_number>\
#Acapela document:
# \rst\  Reset all voices tags (apart RmS, RmW, vol tags)

#Nuance document:
# The control sequence <ESC>\rst\ resets all parameters to the original settings used at the start of synthesis.

u:(in:onActivation) ^goto(intro)

proposal: %intro This is the default volume then going to level 2.  \vol=2\ The volume is set to a low value.  
     # \rst\   # According to the Acapela and Nuance docs, this should work but causes syntax error unexpected "\" at line 16 (character 11)
    \rst=0\  # This works
    Now it is reset to its default value.
